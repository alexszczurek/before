      "“We believe that mindfulness is more than a form of stress relief — it can be a tool for personal growth, deeper understanding, vibrancy. More than a way to disconnect — it can be a way to feel a part of something bigger. More than simply silence — it can be immersive, beautiful, moving.”\n\n–Raed Khawaja, Open Co-founder & CEO\n\nRegulate your nervous system with Open. Bridge science and spirituality to cleanse your body and mind. Learn breathwork, meditation, and movement techniques designed by experts in neurobiology. Practice on the app and in-person at our flagship studio in Los Angeles. \n\nCLASSES\n\nBREATHE: Since the dawn of civilization, humans have developed techniques for manipulating our breath to induce desired states of consciousness. Now peer-reviewed studies in neuroscience and psychology confirm that breathwork is a powerful toolkit for regulating your nervous system, optimizing your health and well-being, and catalyzing personal transformation. Breathwork is an umbrella term for myriad practices, both ancient and modern. While many techniques are deeply rooted in spiritual traditions like Yoga, Qi Gong, and Buddhism, contemporary applications integrate ancient wisdom with modern science.This synthesis of ancient and modern has given rise to transformational breathwork, designed to induce profound experiences of catharsis, insight, and breakthrough. Experience a mental reset with just a few minutes of conscious breathing.\n\nMEDITATE: Train your awareness and contemplate wisdom – with techniques that span generations, cultures, and traditions – with our daily meditations and monthly programs. Learn how to enhance your focus, reduce your stress and anxiety, and regulate your emotions with simple mindfulness techniques you can incorporate into your daily life. \n\nMOVE: Our methodology is designed through the intelligence of fitness – blending endurance, strength, mobility, and recovery – with the wisdom of mindfulness. A ritual for resilience, strengthening the body and mind.\n\nANYTIME, ANYWHERE: Practice on your time with our endless library, with fresh classes added daily. From simple 5-minute breathwork techniques, to 60-minute strength and conditioning classes, build your practice to fit your schedule and meet your goals. Whether you’re starting your journey or seeking a new challenge, there are classes for every level and mood.\n\nPROGRESS TRACKING: Create a daily habit that sticks with progress tracking, push reminders, streaks, and badges. A consistent breathwork and meditation practice has proven to reduce cortisol levels and regulate the nervous system–decreasing stress, supporting emotional well-being, and enhancing mental clarity. These techniques can also improve physical health by increasing heart rate variability, promoting cardiovascular health, and boosting immune function.\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\nQuestions?
